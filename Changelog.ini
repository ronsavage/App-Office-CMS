- Fix bug where we delete a page and none of the remaining pages are flagged as a home page.
The code crashed with the message: Null in page_id violates non-null constraint.
Now, if we can't find a home page, we set the 'current' page to the first daughter of the
(fake) root node in the page menu tree.

- Replace Log::Dispatch with Log::Handler. Speed is not everything, but Log::Handler is faster.
- In .htoffice.csm.conf, change min_log_level to emergency, and add max_log_level as debug.
See Log::Handler for details.
- Replace CGI::Session with Data::Session.
- Add pg_bytea and pg_text to .htoffice.cms.conf, for use by Data::Session.
- Investigate 3 rich text editors: YUI's editor, TinyMCE and CKEditor. I could not get any working
properly with AJAX.
- Rename content form fields from head and body to head_text and body_text, in case one of those words
is reserved in the same way form is reserved in IE. Also, this makes them easier to search for.
