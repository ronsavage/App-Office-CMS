Revision history for Perl extension App::Office::CMS.

0.94  Sat Aug 27 10:46:00 2011
	- Add Plack::Middleware::ContentLength to *.psgi.
	- Unreleased.

0.93  Tue Feb 15 16:19:00 2011
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
	- Rename scripts/schema.sh to scripts/plot.schema.sh.

0.92  Thu Dec  9 13:45:00 2010
	- Fix bug where we delete a page and none of the remaining pages are flagged as a home page.
		The code crashed with the message: Null in page_id violates non-null constraint.
		Now, if we can't find a home page, we set the 'current' page to the first daughter of the
		(fake) root node in the page menu tree.

0.91  Tue Dec  7 12:45:00 2010
	- Replace Log::Dispatch with Log::Handler. Speed is not everything, but Log::Handler is faster.
	- In .htoffice.csm.conf, change min_log_level to emergency, and add max_log_level as debug.
		See Log::Handler for details.
	- Replace CGI::Session with Data::Session.
	- Add pg_bytea and pg_text to .htoffice.cms.conf, for use by Data::Session.
	- Investigate 3 rich text editors: YUI's editor, TinyMCE and CKEditor. I could not get any working
		properly with AJAX.
	- Rename content form fields from head and body to head_text and body_text, in case one of those words
		is reserved in the same way form is reserved in IE. Also, this makes them easier to search for.

0.90  Mon Nov  1 13:20:00 2010
	- Original version.
